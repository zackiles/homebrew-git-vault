# Git-Vault (`gv`)

Drop-dead-simple tool for encrypting sensitive files or folders in git. Git hooks and GPG transparently encrypt and decrypt resources within your repository, keeping them encrypted remotely but available locally seamlessly. Works on all **platforms**, **dummy-proof**, and **secure**! Optionally supports and configures Git LFS, 1Password, and more automatically.
